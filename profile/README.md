## Welcome to Serverless Workflow

**Serverless Workflow** is an open-source, vendor-neutral, and community-driven project that redefines workflow creation with its high-level Domain Specific Language (DSL). Whether you are a developer, architect, or enthusiast, Serverless Workflow enables you to effortlessly design and execute workflows in a serverless environment. 

### Why Serverless Workflow?

Serverless Workflow is designed for ease of use and scalability, offering an intuitive DSL that makes creating complex workflows simple. Our system is event-driven, service-oriented, and FaaS-centric, integrating seamlessly with various platforms and protocols like HTTP, GRPC, and OpenAPI. With robust features for error handling, time management, and scalability, our workflows are both reliable and adaptable across diverse environments.
